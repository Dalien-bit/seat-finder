# seatfinder

A new Flutter project.

On a railroad or ship, a berth is a bed that is typically stacked like bunk beds.

There are five different types of berths available on Indian trains: Lower, Middle, Upper, Side Lower, and Side Upper.

This is a mobile application that, given a seat number, would show the position of the seat and indicate the type of berth it is.
